All that man has to do is to take care of three things; good thought, good word and good deed.
If you think yourselves weak, weak you will be; if you think yourselves strong, strong you will be.
Infinite patience, infinite purity and infinite perseverance are the secret of success in a good cause. 
                                                                                        - by Swami Vivekanandaâ€™
